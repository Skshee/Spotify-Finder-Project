This project utilizes the Spotify Web API, which requires authentication via a client credentials flow. The authentication process involves generating an access token using the provided `client ID` and `client secret`. This token is then used in API requests to access Spotify's data.

Authentication: The project retrieves an access token by making a request to the Spotify authentication server.

Bearer Token Usage: The token must be included in the request headers as a Bearer token for all API calls.
